>For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light
_Ephesians 5:8_


There are 4 things that really popped out to me from this passage.

1. *Walk as the children of light*, for the fruit of the light is found in all that is good and right and true. *v8*
2. Try to *discern* what is pleasing to the Lord, and expose things that are not pleasing to the Lord *v10 - v12*
3. Be careful how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise. *v15*
4. Making the best use of time, because the days are evil. *v16*
